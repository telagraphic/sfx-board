Project specifications:

Hosted on Netlify.
Use Bun for the server. I want to learn how to use it.
Prefer to use vanilla JS, HTML and CSS.
Javascript should use classes or ES modules to organize the code and ES6 syntax.

Looking at your soundboard project, I can see you have a collection of audio clips and a simple web interface. Let me analyze the feasibility of adding the YouTube audio download and trimming functionality you described.

Based on my analysis of your soundboard project, here's my assessment of the feasibility of adding the YouTube audio download and trimming functionality:

## **Yes, this is definitely possible!** Here's how you can implement each component:

### **1. Modal for YouTube URL Input**
✅ **Fully feasible** - This is straightforward HTML/CSS/JavaScript. You can create a modal that appears when clicking an "Add New Sound" button, with a form to input the YouTube URL.

### **2. YouTube Audio Download**
✅ **Possible with some considerations**:

**Option A: Server-side approach (Recommended)**
- Use a Node.js backend with packages like `ytdl-core` or `youtube-dl-exec`
- Download happens on your server, then serve the audio file to the client
- **Pros**: More reliable, handles CORS, can process large files
- **Cons**: Requires server infrastructure, bandwidth costs

**Option B: Client-side approach**
- Use libraries like `youtube-dl` compiled to WebAssembly or similar
- **Pros**: No server needed
- **Cons**: Limited by browser security restrictions, may not work reliably

**Option C: Third-party service**
- Use services like Bunny.net's video processing API
- **Pros**: Scalable, reliable
- **Cons**: Additional costs, dependency on external service

### **3. Audio Trimming UI**
✅ **Fully feasible** - Several approaches:

**Option A: Web Audio API + Canvas**
- Use `AudioContext` to decode audio
- Create a custom waveform visualization with HTML5 Canvas
- Implement draggable trim handles
- **Pros**: Full control, works entirely client-side
- **Cons**: More complex implementation

**Option B: Existing libraries**
- Use libraries like `wavesurfer.js` or `peaks.js`
- These provide ready-made waveform visualizations with trimming capabilities
- **Pros**: Faster development, well-tested
- **Cons**: Additional dependencies

### **4. Save to Soundboard**
✅ **Fully feasible**:

**Server-side approach:**
1. Send trimmed audio data to your server
2. Server processes and stores the file
3. Returns the URL to the client
4. Update your `soundclips.json` file
5. Refresh the soundboard

**Client-side approach:**
1. Store trimmed audio in browser's IndexedDB
2. Generate a blob URL for playback
3. **Limitation**: Audio won't persist across browser sessions

## **Recommended Implementation Strategy:**

1. **Backend**: Node.js/Express server with:
   - `ytdl-core` for YouTube downloads
   - `fluent-ffmpeg` for audio processing
   - File storage (local or cloud)

2. **Frontend**: 
   - Modal for URL input
   - `wavesurfer.js` for audio visualization and trimming
   - File upload to server after trimming

3. **Workflow**:
   ```
   User enters URL → Server downloads → Client receives audio → 
   User trims in browser → Client sends trimmed data to server → 
   Server saves and returns URL → Soundboard updates
   ```

## **Technical Challenges to Consider:**

1. **YouTube Terms of Service**: Ensure compliance with YouTube's terms
2. **File size limits**: Large videos may need chunked processing
3. **Audio format compatibility**: Ensure consistent formats (MP3/WAV)
4. **Error handling**: Network issues, invalid URLs, processing failures
5. **Storage costs**: If using cloud storage like Bunny.net

## **Alternative Simplified Approach:**

If you want to start simpler, you could:
1. Allow users to upload their own audio files
2. Implement the trimming functionality
3. Add YouTube download later

This would let you build the core trimming functionality without the complexity of YouTube integration initially.

**Would you like me to elaborate on any specific part of this implementation, or would you prefer to start with a particular component?**
